## 2026-04-22... Phase 1: Values Layer Shipped

First QOS schema complete. `values.v1.schema.json` plus a reference implementation (`QWF.values.json` + `QWR.values.json`), a cascade-enforcing resolver, and a Values Editor build spec. 4,635 lines across 7 files. Phase 2 is `voice.json` plus the `brand.v2.3` refactor.

The values layer encodes TIG's 5-line compass structurally: people first, wisdom as fuel, values as compass, curiosity plus focus for balance, love for legacy. Cascade policy enforces ABSOLUTE rules across children. The resolver catches 6 classes of cascade violation at resolve time... not at review time.

- `values.v1.schema.json` (15 `$defs`, 519 lines)
- `QWF.values.json` (33 embedded tests, 1,201 lines)
- `QWR.values.json` (override-only child, 207 lines)
- `QWR.values.resolved.json` (auto-generated with full lineage, 1,369 lines)
- `validate_values.py` + `resolve_values.py` (production CLIs)
- `Values-Editor-Spec-v1.md` (buildable spec for first QOP page)
